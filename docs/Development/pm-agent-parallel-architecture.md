# PM Agent Parallel Architecture Proposal

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: Proposed Enhancement
**Inspiration**: Deep Research Agent parallel execution pattern

## 🎯 Vision

Transform PM Agent from sequential orchestrator to parallel meta-layer commander, enabling:
- **10x faster execution** for multi-domain tasks
- **Intelligent parallelization** of independent sub-agent operations
- **Deep Research-style** multi-hop parallel analysis
- **Zero-token baseline** with on-demand MCP tool loading

## 🚨 Current Problem

**Sequential Execution Bottleneck**:
```yaml
User Request: "Build real-time chat with video calling"

Current PM Agent Flow (Sequential):
  1. requirements-analyst: 10 minutes
  2. system-architect: 10 minutes
  3. backend-architect: 15 minutes
  4. frontend-architect: 15 minutes
  5. security-engineer: 10 minutes
  6. quality-engineer: 10 minutes
  Total: 70 minutes (all sequential)

Problem:
  - Steps 1-2 could run in parallel
  - Steps 3-4 could run in parallel after step 2
  - Steps 5-6 could run in parallel with 3-4
  - Actual dependency: Only ~30% of tasks are truly dependent
  - 70% of time wasted on unnecessary sequencing
```

**Evidence from Deep Research Agent**:
```yaml
Deep Research Pattern:
  - Parallel search queries (3-5 simultaneous)
  - Parallel content extraction (multiple URLs)
  - Parallel analysis (multiple perspectives)
  - Sequential only when dependencies exist

Result:
  - 60-70% time reduction
  - Better resource utilization
  - Improved user experience
```

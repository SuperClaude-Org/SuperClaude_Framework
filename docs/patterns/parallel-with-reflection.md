## 🎯 Problem

**並列実行の落とし穴**:
```yaml
❌ Naive Parallel Execution:
  Read file1, file2, file3, file4, file5 (parallel)
  → Process immediately
  → 問題: ファイル読めてない、矛盾あり、確信度低い
  → Result: 間違った方向に爆速で突進 🚀💥
  → Cost: 5,000-50,000 wasted tokens
```

**研究からの警告**:
> "Parallel agents can get things wrong and potentially cause harm"
> — Simon Willison, "Embracing parallel coding agent lifestyle" (Oct 2025)

## ✅ Solution

**Wave → Checkpoint → Wave Pattern**:
```yaml
✅ Safe Parallel Execution:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read (5 files, 0.5秒)
  ↓
  Checkpoint - Reflection (200 tokens, 0.2秒)
    - Self-Check: "全部読めた？矛盾ない？確信度は？"
    - IF issues OR confidence < 70%:
        → STOP → Request clarification
    - ELSE:
        → Proceed to Wave 2
  ↓
  Wave 2 - PARALLEL Process (next operations)
```

## 🔧 Implementation

### Template: Session Start

```yaml
Session Start Protocol:
  Repository Detection:
    - Bash "git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || echo $PWD && mkdir -p docs/memory"

  Wave 1 - Context Restoration (PARALLEL):
    - PARALLEL Read all memory files:
      * Read docs/memory/pm_context.md
      * Read docs/memory/current_plan.json
      * Read docs/memory/last_session.md
      * Read docs/memory/next_actions.md
      * Read docs/memory/patterns_learned.jsonl

  Checkpoint - Confidence Check (200 tokens):
    ❓ "全ファイル読めた？"
       → Verify all Read operations succeeded
    ❓ "コンテキストに矛盾ない？"
       → Check for contradictions across files
    ❓ "次のアクション実行に十分な情報？"
       → Assess confidence level (target: >70%)

    Decision Logic:
      IF any_issues OR confidence < 70%:
        → STOP execution
        → Report issues to user
        → Request clarification
        → Example: "⚠️ Confidence Low (65%)
                     Missing information:
                     - What authentication method? (JWT/OAuth?)
                     - Session timeout policy?
                     Please clarify before proceeding."
      ELSE:
        → High confidence (>70%)
        → Proceed to next wave
        → Continue with implementation

  Wave 2 (if applicable):
    - Next set of parallel operations...
```

### Template: Session End

```yaml
Session End Protocol:
  Completion Checklist:
    - [ ] All tasks completed or documented as blocked
    - [ ] No partial implementations
    - [ ] Tests passing
    - [ ] Documentation updated

  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Write (4 files):
    - Write docs/memory/last_session.md
    - Write docs/memory/next_actions.md
    - Write docs/memory/pm_context.md
    - Write docs/memory/session_summary.json

  Checkpoint - Validation (200 tokens):
    ❓ "全ファイル書き込み成功？"
       → Evidence: Bash "ls docs/memory/"
       → Verify all 4 files exist
    ❓ "内容に整合性ある？"
       → Check file sizes > 0 bytes
       → Verify no contradictions between files
    ❓ "次回セッションで復元可能？"
       → Validate JSON files parse correctly
       → Ensure actionable next_actions

    Decision Logic:
      IF validation_fails:
        → Report specific failures
        → Retry failed writes
        → Re-validate
      ELSE:
        → All validations passed ✅
        → Session end confirmed
        → State safely preserved
```

## 💰 Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Token Economics

```yaml
Checkpoint Cost:
  Simple check: 200 tokens
  Medium check: 500 tokens
  Complex check: 1,000 tokens

Prevented Waste:
  Wrong direction (simple): 5,000 tokens saved
  Wrong direction (medium): 15,000 tokens saved
  Wrong direction (complex): 50,000 tokens saved

ROI:
  Best case: 50,000 / 200 = 250x return
  Average case: 15,000 / 200 = 75x return
  Worst case (no issues): -200 tokens (0.1% overhead)

Net Savings:
  When preventing errors: 96-99.6% reduction
  When no errors: -0.1% overhead (negligible)
```

### Performance Impact

```yaml
Execution Time:
  Parallel read (5 files): 0.5秒
  Reflection checkpoint: 0.2秒
  Total: 0.7秒

Naive Sequential:
  Sequential read (5 files): 2.5秒
  No checkpoint: 0秒
  Total: 2.5秒

Naive Parallel (no checkpoint):
  Parallel read (5 files): 0.5秒
  No checkpoint: 0秒
  Error recovery: 30-300秒 (if wrong direction)
  Total: 0.5秒 (best) OR 30-300秒 (worst)

Comparison:
  Safe Parallel (this pattern): 0.7秒 (consistent)
  Naive Sequential: 2.5秒 (3.5x slower)
  Naive Parallel: 0.5秒-300秒 (unreliable)

Result: This pattern is 3.5x faster than sequential with safety guarantees
```

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Example 1: High Confidence Path

```yaml
Context:
  User: "Show current project status"
  Complexity: Light (read-only)

Execution:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read:
    - Read pm_context.md ✅
    - Read last_session.md ✅
    - Read next_actions.md ✅
    - Read patterns_learned.jsonl ✅

  Checkpoint:
    ❓ All files loaded? → Yes ✅
    ❓ Contradictions? → None ✅
    ❓ Sufficient info? → Yes ✅
    Confidence: 95% (High)

  Decision: Proceed immediately

Outcome:
  Total time: 0.7秒
  Tokens used: 1,200 (read + checkpoint)
  User experience: "Instant response" ✅
```

### Example 2: Low Confidence Detection

```yaml
Context:
  User: "Implement authentication"
  Complexity: Heavy (feature implementation)

Execution:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read:
    - Read pm_context.md ✅
    - Read last_session.md ✅
    - Read next_actions.md ⚠️ (mentions "auth TBD")
    - Read patterns_learned.jsonl ✅

  Checkpoint:
    ❓ All files loaded? → Yes ✅
    ❓ Contradictions? → None ✅
    ❓ Sufficient info? → No ❌
       - Authentication method unclear (JWT/OAuth/Supabase?)
       - Session timeout not specified
       - 2FA requirements unknown
    Confidence: 65% (Low) ⚠️

  Decision: STOP → Request clarification

Report to User:
  "⚠️ Confidence Low (65%)

   Before implementing authentication, I need:
   1. Authentication method: JWT, OAuth, or Supabase Auth?
   2. Session timeout: 1 hour, 24 hours, or 7 days?
   3. 2FA required: Yes or No?
   4. Password policy: Requirements?

   Please clarify so I can implement correctly."

Outcome:
  Tokens used: 1,200 (read + checkpoint + clarification)
  Prevented waste: 15,000-30,000 tokens (wrong implementation)
  Net savings: 93-96% ✅
  User experience: "Asked right questions" ✅
```

### Example 3: Validation Failure Recovery

```yaml
Context:
  Session end after implementing feature

Execution:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Write:
    - Write last_session.md ✅
    - Write next_actions.md ✅
    - Write pm_context.md ❌ (write failed, disk full)
    - Write session_summary.json ✅

  Checkpoint:
    ❓ All files written? → No ❌
       Evidence: Bash "ls docs/memory/"
       Missing: pm_context.md
    ❓ Content coherent? → Cannot verify (missing file)

  Decision: Validation failed → Retry

Recovery:
  - Free disk space
  - Retry write pm_context.md ✅
  - Re-run checkpoint
  - All files present ✅
  - Validation passed ✅

Outcome:
  State safely preserved (no data loss)
  Automatic error detection and recovery
  User unaware of transient failure ✅
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 1: Skip Checkpoint

```yaml
Wrong:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read
  → Immediately proceed to Wave 2
  → No validation

Problem:
  - Files might not have loaded
  - Context might have contradictions
  - Confidence might be low
  → Charges ahead in wrong direction

Cost: 5,000-50,000 wasted tokens
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 2: Checkpoint Without Action

```yaml
Wrong:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read
  → Checkpoint detects low confidence (65%)
  → Log warning but proceed anyway

Problem:
  - Checkpoint is pointless if ignored
  - Still charges ahead wrong direction

Cost: 200 tokens (checkpoint) + 15,000 tokens (wrong impl) = waste
```

### ❌ Anti-Pattern 3: Over-Budget Checkpoint

```yaml
Wrong:
  Wave 1 - PARALLEL Read
  → Checkpoint uses 5,000 tokens
     - Full re-analysis of all files
     - Detailed comparison
     - Comprehensive validation

Problem:
  - Checkpoint more expensive than prevented waste
  - Net negative ROI

Cost: 5,000 tokens for simple check (should be 200)
```

---

## ✅ Best Practices

### 1. Budget Appropriately

```yaml
Simple Task (read-only):
  Checkpoint: 200 tokens
  Questions: "Loaded? Contradictions?"

Medium Task (feature):
  Checkpoint: 500 tokens
  Questions: "Loaded? Contradictions? Sufficient info?"

Complex Task (system redesign):
  Checkpoint: 1,000 tokens
  Questions: "Loaded? Contradictions? All dependencies? Confidence?"
```

### 2. Stop on Low Confidence

```yaml
Confidence Thresholds:
  High (90-100%): Proceed immediately
  Medium (70-89%): Proceed with caution, note assumptions
  Low (<70%): STOP → Request clarification

Never proceed below 70% confidence
```

### 3. Provide Evidence

```yaml
Validation Evidence:
  File operations:
    - Bash "ls target_directory/"
    - File size checks (> 0 bytes)
    - JSON parse validation

  Context validation:
    - Cross-reference between files
    - Logical consistency checks
    - Required fields present
```

### 4. Clear User Communication

```yaml
Low Confidence Report:
  ⚠️ Status: Confidence Low (65%)

  Missing Information:
    1. [Specific unclear requirement]
    2. [Another gap]

  Request:
    Please clarify [X] so I can proceed confidently

  Why It Matters:
    Without this, I might implement [wrong approach]
```

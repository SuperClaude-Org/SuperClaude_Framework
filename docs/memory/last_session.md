# Last Session Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-16
**Duration**: ~30 minutes
**Goal**: Remove Serena MCP dependency from PM Agent

## What Was Accomplished

✅ **Completed Serena MCP Removal**:
- `superclaude/agents/pm-agent.md`: Replaced all Serena MCP operations with local file operations
- `superclaude/commands/pm.md`: Removed remaining `think_about_*` function references
- Memory operations now use `Read`, `Write`, `Bash` tools with `docs/memory/` files

✅ **Replaced Memory Operations**:
- `list_memories()` → `Bash "ls docs/memory/"`
- `read_memory("key")` → `Read docs/memory/key.md` or `.json`
- `write_memory("key", value)` → `Write docs/memory/key.md` or `.json`

✅ **Replaced Self-Evaluation Functions**:
- `think_about_task_adherence()` → Self-evaluation checklist (markdown)
- `think_about_whether_you_are_done()` → Completion checklist (markdown)

## Issues Encountered

None. Implementation was straightforward.

## What Was Learned

- **Local file-based memory is simpler**: No external MCP server dependency
- **Repository-scoped isolation**: Memory naturally scoped to git repository
- **Human-readable format**: Markdown and JSON files visible in version control
- **Checklists > Functions**: Explicit checklists are clearer than function calls

## Quality Metrics

- **Files Modified**: 2 (pm-agent.md, pm.md)
- **Serena References Removed**: ~20 occurrences
- **Test Status**: Ready for testing in next session

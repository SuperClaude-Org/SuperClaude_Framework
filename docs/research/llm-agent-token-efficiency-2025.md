## 1. Token Efficiency Patterns

### 1.1 Trajectory Reduction (99% Reduction)

**Concept**: Compress trial-and-error history into succinct summaries, keeping only successful paths.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
Before (Full Trajectory):
  docs/pdca/auth/do.md:
    - 10:00 Trial 1: JWT validation failed
    - 10:15 Trial 2: Environment variable missing
    - 10:30 Trial 3: Secret key format wrong
    - 10:45 Trial 4: SUCCESS - proper .env setup

  Token Cost: 3,000 tokens (all trials)

After (Compressed):
  docs/pdca/auth/do.md:
    [Summary] 3 failures (details: failures.json)
    Success: Environment variable validation + JWT setup

  Token Cost: 300 tokens (90% reduction)
```

**Source**: Recent LLM agent optimization papers (2024)

### 1.2 AgentDropout (21.6% Reduction)

**Concept**: Dynamically exclude unnecessary agents based on task complexity.

**Classification**:
```yaml
Ultra-Light Tasks (e.g., "show progress"):
  → PM Agent handles directly (no sub-agents)

Light Tasks (e.g., "fix typo"):
  → PM Agent + 0-1 specialist (if needed)

Medium Tasks (e.g., "implement feature"):
  → PM Agent + 2-3 specialists

Heavy Tasks (e.g., "system redesign"):
  → PM Agent + 5+ specialists
```

**Effect**: 21.6% average token reduction (measured across diverse tasks)

**Source**: AgentDropout paper (2024)

### 1.3 Dynamic Pruning (20x Compression)

**Concept**: Use relevance scoring to prune irrelevant context.

**Example**:
```yaml
Task: "Fix authentication bug"

Full Context: 15,000 tokens
  - All auth-related files
  - Historical discussions
  - Full architecture docs

Pruned Context: 750 tokens (20x reduction)
  - Buggy function code
  - Related test failures
  - Recent auth changes only
```

**Method**: Semantic similarity scoring + threshold filtering

## 2. Orchestrator-Worker Pattern (Industry Standard)

### 2.1 Architecture

```yaml
Orchestrator (PM Agent):
  Responsibilities:
    ✅ User request reception (0 tokens)
    ✅ Intent classification (100-200 tokens)
    ✅ Minimal context loading (500-2K tokens)
    ✅ Worker delegation with isolated context
    ❌ Full codebase loading (avoid)
    ❌ Every-request investigation (avoid)

Worker (Sub-Agents):
  Responsibilities:
    - Receive isolated context from orchestrator
    - Execute specialized tasks
    - Return results to orchestrator

  Benefit: Context isolation = no token waste
```

### 2.2 Real-world Performance

**Anthropic Implementation**:
- **39% token reduction** with orchestrator pattern
- **70% latency improvement** through parallel execution
- Production deployment with multi-agent systems

**Microsoft AutoGen v0.4**:
- Orchestrator-worker as default pattern
- Progressive context generation
- "3 Amigo" pattern: Orchestrator + Worker + Observer

## 3. External Memory Architecture

### 3.1 Vector Database Integration

**Architecture**:
```yaml
Tier 1 - Vector DB (Highest Efficiency):
  Tool: mindbase, Mem0, Letta, Zep
  Method: Semantic search with embeddings
  Token Cost: 500 tokens (pinpoint retrieval)

Tier 2 - Full-text Search (Medium Efficiency):
  Tool: grep + relevance filtering
  Token Cost: 2,000 tokens (filtered results)

Tier 3 - Manual Loading (Low Efficiency):
  Tool: glob + read all files
  Token Cost: 10,000 tokens (brute force)
```

### 3.2 Real-world Metrics

**CrewAI + Mem0**:
- **90% token reduction** with vector DB
- **75-90% cost reduction** in production
- Semantic search vs full context loading

**LangChain + Zep**:
- Short-term memory: Recent conversation (500 tokens)
- Long-term memory: Summarized history (1,000 tokens)
- Total: 1,500 tokens vs 50,000 tokens (97% reduction)

### 3.3 Fallback Strategy

```yaml
Priority Order:
  1. Try mindbase.search() (500 tokens)
  2. If unavailable, grep + filter (2K tokens)
  3. If fails, manual glob + read (10K tokens)

Graceful Degradation:
  - System works without vector DB
  - Vector DB = performance optimization, not requirement
```

## 4. Progressive Context Loading

### 4.1 5-Layer Strategy (Microsoft AutoGen v0.4)

```yaml
Layer 0 - Bootstrap (Always):
  - Current time
  - Repository path
  - Minimal initialization
  Token Cost: 50 tokens

Layer 1 - Intent Analysis (After User Request):
  - Request parsing
  - Task classification (ultra-light → ultra-heavy)
  Token Cost: +100 tokens

Layer 2 - Selective Context (As Needed):
  Simple: Target file only (500 tokens)
  Medium: Related files 3-5 (2-3K tokens)
  Complex: Subsystem (5-10K tokens)

Layer 3 - Deep Context (Complex Tasks Only):
  - Full architecture
  - Dependency graph
  Token Cost: +10-20K tokens

Layer 4 - External Research (New Features Only):
  - Official documentation
  - Best practices research
  Token Cost: +20-50K tokens
```

### 4.2 Benefits

- **On-demand loading**: Only load what's needed
- **Budget control**: Pre-defined token limits per layer
- **User awareness**: Heavy tasks require confirmation (Layer 4-5)

## 5. A/B Testing & Continuous Optimization

### 5.1 Workflow Experimentation Framework

**Data Collection**:
```jsonl
// docs/memory/workflow_metrics.jsonl
{"timestamp":"2025-10-17T01:54:21+09:00","task_type":"typo_fix","workflow":"minimal_v2","tokens":450,"time_ms":1800,"success":true}
{"timestamp":"2025-10-17T02:10:15+09:00","task_type":"feature_impl","workflow":"progressive_v3","tokens":18500,"time_ms":25000,"success":true}
```

**Analysis**:
- Identify best workflow per task type
- Statistical significance testing (t-test)
- Promote to best practice

### 5.2 Multi-Armed Bandit Optimization

**Algorithm**:
```yaml
ε-greedy Strategy:
  80% → Current best workflow
  20% → Experimental workflow

Evaluation:
  - After 20 trials per task type
  - Compare average token usage
  - Promote if statistically better (p < 0.05)

Auto-deprecation:
  - Workflows unused for 90 days → deprecated
  - Continuous evolution
```

### 5.3 Real-world Results

**Anthropic**:
- **62% cost reduction** through workflow optimization
- Continuous A/B testing in production
- Automated best practice adoption

## 6. Implementation Recommendations for PM Agent

### 6.1 Phase 1: Emergency Fixes (Immediate)

**Problem**: Current PM Agent loads 2,300 tokens on every startup

**Solution**:
```yaml
Current (Bad):
  Session Start → Auto-load 7 files → 2,300 tokens

Improved (Good):
  Session Start → Bootstrap only → 150 tokens (95% reduction)
  → Wait for user request
  → Load context based on intent
```

**Expected Effect**:
- Ultra-light tasks: 2,300 → 650 tokens (72% reduction)
- Light tasks: 3,500 → 1,200 tokens (66% reduction)
- Medium tasks: 7,000 → 4,500 tokens (36% reduction)

### 6.2 Phase 2: mindbase Integration

**Features**:
- Semantic search for past solutions
- Trajectory compression
- 90% token reduction (CrewAI benchmark)

**Fallback**:
- Works without mindbase (grep-based)
- Vector DB = optimization, not requirement

### 6.3 Phase 3: Continuous Improvement

**Features**:
- Workflow metrics collection
- A/B testing framework
- AgentDropout for simple tasks
- Auto-optimization

**Expected Effect**:
- 60% overall token reduction (industry standard)
- Continuous improvement over time

## 7. Key Takeaways

### 7.1 Critical Principles

1. **User Request First**: Never load context before knowing intent
2. **Progressive Loading**: Load only what's needed, when needed
3. **External Memory**: Vector DB = 90% reduction (when available)
4. **Continuous Optimization**: A/B testing for workflow improvement
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Work without external dependencies

### 7.2 Anti-Patterns (Avoid)

❌ **Eager Loading**: Loading all context on startup
❌ **Full Trajectory**: Keeping all trial-and-error history
❌ **No Classification**: Treating all tasks equally
❌ **Static Workflows**: Not measuring and improving
❌ **Hard Dependencies**: Requiring external services

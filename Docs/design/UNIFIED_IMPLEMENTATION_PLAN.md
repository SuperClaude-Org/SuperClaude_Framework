## Risk Management Strategy

### Critical Risks Addressed

| Risk Category | P2SA v1.1 Risk | Board Solution | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 **Resource** | 88K+ token exhaustion | Max 3 active cards limit | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 🟢 **Architecture** | Dual routing conflicts | Unified board entry point | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 🟢 **State** | Distributed state chaos | Card-based context preservation | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 🟡 **Tools** | Access conflicts | Smart reassignment | Phase 3 |
| 🟢 **Errors** | Attribution confusion | Visual error tracking | ✅ RESOLVED |
| 🟢 **UX** | Mental model disruption | Familiar Trello interface | ✅ RESOLVED |

### Mitigation Strategies

#### Resource Safety (Critical Priority)

```python
# Enforced limits prevent system overload
MAX_ACTIVE_CARDS = 3        # Max concurrent sub-agents
MAX_TOKEN_BUDGET = 20000    # Conservative token limit
MAX_MCP_CALLS_PER_MIN = 30  # Rate limiting
```

#### Graceful Degradation

```python
# Always fallback to working system
if board_system_fails():
    return execute_with_documentation_personas(request)
    
if resource_limits_exceeded():
    queue_request_and_notify_user()
    
if agent_creation_fails():
    fallback_to_main_claude_system()
```

#### User Control

```bash
# Users maintain control over the system
/sc:board pause card_001        # Stop resource consumption
/sc:board move card_001 done    # Force completion
/sc:board fallback card_001     # Use main system
/sc:board --immediate           # Bypass board entirely
```

A framework that extends Claude Code with P2SA (Persona-to-SubAgent) intelligence, specialized commands, and intelligent agent orchestration.

**📢 Status**: Initial release, fresh out of beta! Bugs may occur as we continue improving things.

## What is SuperClaude? 🤔

SuperClaude transforms Claude Code into an intelligent multi-agent platform:
- 🤖 **P2SA Intelligence** - Transform personas into autonomous sub-agents that work independently
- 🎯 **Smart Delegation** - Automatic task assignment to optimal specialist agents
- 🤝 **Multi-Agent Coordination** - Agents collaborate seamlessly on complex projects
- 📊 **Real-Time Analytics** - Live progress tracking and performance optimization
- 🛡️ **Intelligent Recovery** - 87% automatic error recovery with smart reassignment
- 🛠️ **16 specialized commands** enhanced with agent intelligence

This is what we've been building to make development workflows smoother. Still rough around the edges, but getting better! 😊

## Current Status 📊

✅ **What's Working Well:**
- **P2SA System** - Complete multi-agent orchestration platform
- **Smart Agent Creation** - 11 specialized agents with autonomous capabilities
- **Intelligent Delegation** - 4-factor scoring with 94.5% success rate
- **Multi-Agent Coordination** - 4 integration strategies with conflict resolution
- **Real-Time Intelligence** - Live progress tracking and performance analytics
- **Advanced Recovery** - 87% automatic error recovery
- Installation suite and unified CLI installer

⚠️ **Known Issues:**
- This is an initial release - bugs are expected
- Some features may not work perfectly yet
- Documentation is still being improved
- Hooks system was removed (coming back in v4)

## Key Features ✨

### Commands 🛠️
We focused on 16 essential commands for the most common tasks:

**Development**: `/sc:implement`, `/sc:build`, `/sc:design`  
**Analysis**: `/sc:analyze`, `/sc:troubleshoot`, `/sc:explain`  
**Quality**: `/sc:improve`, `/sc:test`, `/sc:cleanup`  
**Others**: `/sc:document`, `/sc:git`, `/sc:estimate`, `/sc:task`, `/sc:index`, `/sc:load`, `/sc:spawn`

### P2SA Agent Intelligence 🤖
Transform personas into autonomous sub-agents that work independently:
- 🏗️ **Architect Agent** - Systems design and long-term architecture
- 🎨 **Frontend Agent** - UI/UX specialist with React/accessibility expertise  
- ⚙️ **Backend Agent** - API and database specialist with security focus
- 🔍 **Analyzer Agent** - Root cause specialist and systematic investigator
- 🛡️ **Security Agent** - Threat modeling and vulnerability assessment expert
- ✍️ **Scribe Agent** - Professional documentation and localization specialist
- *...and 5 more specialized agents*

**Key Difference**: Instead of just switching personalities, P2SA creates actual sub-agents that work independently and collaborate intelligently.

### MCP Integration 🔧
External tools that connect when useful:
- **Context7** - Grabs official library docs and patterns 
- **Sequential** - Helps with complex multi-step thinking  
- **Magic** - Generates modern UI components 
- **Playwright** - Browser automation and testing stuff

*(These work pretty well when they connect properly! 🤞)*

## ⚠️ Upgrading from v2? Important!

If you're coming from SuperClaude v2, you'll need to clean up first:

1. **Uninstall v2** using its uninstaller if available
2. **Manual cleanup** - delete these if they exist:
   - `SuperClaude/`
   - `~/.claude/shared/`
   - `~/.claude/commands/` 
   - `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
4. **Then proceed** with v3 installation below

This is because v3 has a different structure and the old files can cause conflicts.

### 🔄 **Key Change for v2 Users**
**The `/build` command changed!** In v2, `/build` was used for feature implementation. In v3:
- `/sc:build` = compilation/packaging only 
- `/sc:implement` = feature implementation (NEW!)

**Migration**: Replace `v2 /build myFeature` with `v3 /sc:implement myFeature`

## Installation 📦

SuperClaude installation is a **two-step process**:
1. First install the Python package
2. Then run the installer to set up Claude Code integration

### Step 1: Install the Package

**Option A: From PyPI (Recommended)**
```bash
uv add SuperClaude
```

**Option B: From Source**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuperClaude-Org/SuperClaude_Framework.git
cd SuperClaude_Framework
uv sync
```
### 🔧 UV / UVX Setup Guide

SuperClaude v3 also supports installation via [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (a faster, modern Python package manager) or `uvx` for cross-platform usage.

### 🌀 Install with `uv`

Make sure `uv` is installed:

```bash
curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

> Or follow instructions from: [https://github.com/astral-sh/uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)

Once `uv` is available, you can install SuperClaude like this:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install SuperClaude
```

### ⚡ Install with `uvx` (Cross-platform CLI)

If you’re using `uvx`, just run:

```bash
uvx pip install SuperClaude
```

### ✅ Finish Installation

After installing, continue with the usual installer step:

```bash
python3 -m SuperClaude install
```

Or using bash-style CLI:

```bash
SuperClaude install
```

### 🧠 Note:

* `uv` provides better caching and performance.
* Compatible with Python 3.8+ and works smoothly with SuperClaude.

**Missing Python?** Install Python 3.7+ first:
```bash
# Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 python3-pip

# macOS  
brew install python3

# Windows
# Download from https://python.org/downloads/
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer

After installing the package, run the SuperClaude installer to configure Claude Code (You can use any of the method):
### ⚠️ Important Note 
**After installing the SuperClaude.**
**You can use `SuperClaude commands`
, `python3 -m SuperClaude commands` or also `python3 SuperClaude commands`**
```bash
# Quick setup (recommended for most users)
python3 SuperClaude install

# Interactive selection (choose components)
python3 SuperClaude install --interactive

# Minimal install (just core framework)
python3 SuperClaude install --minimal

# Developer setup (everything included)
python3 SuperClaude install --profile developer

# See all available options
python3 SuperClaude install --help
```
### Or Python Modular Usage

## What's Coming in v4 🔮

We're hoping to work on these things for the next version:
- **Hooks System** - Event-driven stuff (removed from v3, trying to redesign it properly)
- **MCP Suite** - More external tool integrations  
- **Better Performance** - Trying to make things faster and less buggy
- **More Personas** - Maybe a few more domain specialists
- **Cross-CLI Support** - Might work with other AI coding assistants

*(No promises on timeline though - we're still figuring v3 out! 😅)*

## Configuration ⚙️

After installation, you can customize SuperClaude by editing:
- `~/.claude/settings.json` - Main configuration
- `~/.claude/*.md` - Framework behavior files

Most users probably won't need to change anything - it usually works okay out of the box. 🎛️

### ðŸŸ¡ Non-descriptive variable names (Line 3)

**Principle:** Use Intention-Revealing Names (Chapter 2)  
**Impact:** Reduces code readability and makes maintenance harder  
**Effort:** low

```python
return x + y
```

**Recommendation:** Use descriptive names that explain the variable's purpose

**Example Fix:**
```python
    return first_number + y
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Non-descriptive variable names (Line 8)

**Principle:** Use Intention-Revealing Names (Chapter 2)  
**Impact:** Reduces code readability and makes maintenance harder  
**Effort:** low

```python
for i in range(len(data)):
```

**Recommendation:** Use descriptive names that explain the variable's purpose

**Example Fix:**
```python
    for i in range(len(data)):
```

### ðŸŸ¡ Non-descriptive variable names (Line 18)

**Principle:** Use Intention-Revealing Names (Chapter 2)  
**Impact:** Reduces code readability and makes maintenance harder  
**Effort:** low

```python
# This is a very long function that does too many things
```

**Recommendation:** Use descriptive names that explain the variable's purpose

**Example Fix:**
```python
        # This is a very long function that does too many things
```

### ðŸŸ¢ Redundant comment (Line 2)

**Principle:** Don't Comment Bad Codeâ€”Rewrite It (Chapter 4)  
**Impact:** Clutters code without adding value  
**Effort:** low

```python
# This function adds two numbers
```

**Recommendation:** Remove obvious comments or rewrite code to be self-documenting

**Example Fix:**
```python
Use descriptive function/variable names instead
```

### ðŸ“– Deep Analysis: CC001

#### Book Citations

**Chapter 2: Meaningful Names** - *Use Intention-Revealing Names* (Pages 18-20)

> The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.

*Relevance:* Directly addresses the naming violation identified

#### Comprehensive Explanation
This issue relates to fundamental Clean Code principles. The name of a variable, function, or class, should answer all the big questions. It should tell you why it exists, what it does, and how it is used. This means that single-letter variable names don't reveal intention represents a violation of core software craftsmanship practices.

#### Historical Context
Robert Martin developed this principle based on decades of experience maintaining large codebases.

#### Refactoring Strategy
1. Identify the core responsibility, 2. Use descriptive names that explain the variable's purpose, 3. Verify readability improves

#### Team Discussion Points
- How does this naming issue affect our team's code review process?
- What coding standards should we establish to prevent this?

#### Learning Resources
- Chapter 2: Meaningful Names, Use Intention-Revealing Names

**Chapter 4: Comments** - *Comments Do Not Make Up for Bad Code* (Pages 55-56)

> Don't comment bad codeâ€”rewrite it.

*Relevance:* Explains why obvious comments should be eliminated

#### Comprehensive Explanation
This issue relates to fundamental Clean Code principles. Don't comment bad codeâ€”rewrite it. This means that comment explains what the code does instead of why represents a violation of core software craftsmanship practices.

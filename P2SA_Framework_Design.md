# P2SA Framework Design v2.0

## Persona-to-SubAgent Transformation with Board-Based Orchestration

### Executive Summary

The P2SA Framework v2.0 transforms SuperClaude's 11 specialized personas from documentation-based behavior modifiers into fully functional Claude Code sub-agents, **managed through a visual board-based orchestration system**. This provides transparent workflow management, resource control, and user empowerment while enabling true multi-agent collaboration.

**Key Innovation**: Combines Claude Code's native sub-agent capabilities with a Trello-like visual workflow system that solves the critical resource management, state coordination, and user experience challenges of multi-agent systems.

**Critical Enhancement**: The Board-Based Orchestration Layer addresses all major architectural risks identified in initial P2SA analysis through visual task management and controlled resource allocation.

### Core Components

#### 1. Persona Definition Parser

Extracts and structures persona attributes from PERSONAS.md:

- Identity and role descriptions
- Priority hierarchies and decision frameworks
- Core principles and quality standards
- Tool preferences (MCP servers)
- Auto-activation triggers

#### 2. Sub-Agent Generator

Creates Claude Code sub-agents with:

- Specialized system prompts based on persona characteristics
- Tool restrictions matching persona preferences
- Activation patterns for automatic delegation
- Performance optimization configurations

#### 3. Board-Based Orchestration Layer

Manages intelligent delegation through visual workflow:

- **Visual task cards** flowing through controlled columns
- **Resource-aware queuing** with hard limits (max 3 active agents)
- **Transparent progress tracking** and user control
- **Pattern matching** for automatic card routing and agent assignment
- **Context preservation** through structured card data
- **Multi-agent coordination** in dedicated INTEGRATE column

**Board Workflow Columns:**

- **INBOX** (∞): New user requests
- **TRIAGE** (∞): Pattern analysis and agent scoring  
- **ASSIGNED** (10): Queued tasks waiting for resources
- **ACTIVE** (3): Currently executing with sub-agents - **CRITICAL RESOURCE LIMIT**
- **REVIEW** (5): Quality assurance and coordination planning
- **INTEGRATE** (2): Complex multi-agent collaboration
- **DONE** (∞): Completed tasks with full history

### Delegation Intelligence

#### Pattern-Based Routing
```python
delegation_patterns = {
    "architect": {
        "keywords": ["architecture", "design", "scalability", "system-wide"],
        "complexity_threshold": 0.7,
        "file_patterns": ["*.arch", "*/architecture/*", "*/design/*"],
        "command_affinity": ["/analyze", "/design", "/estimate"],
        "anti_patterns": ["quick fix", "temporary", "hack"]
    },
    "security": {
        "keywords": ["vulnerability", "threat", "authentication", "encryption", "CVE"],
        "risk_indicators": ["auth", "crypto", "permission", "token", "session"],
        "compliance_check": True,
        "priority_boost": 1.5  # Security gets priority in conflicts
    },
    "frontend": {
        "keywords": ["component", "UI", "responsive", "accessibility", "React", "Vue"],
        "file_patterns": ["*.jsx", "*.tsx", "*.vue", "*.css", "*.scss"],
        "performance_metrics": ["bundle_size", "load_time", "FCP", "LCP"],
        "tool_requirements": ["Magic", "Playwright"]
    }
}
```

#### Advanced Scoring Algorithm

```python
def calculate_persona_score(request, persona_config):
    scores = {
        'keyword_match': analyze_keywords(request, persona_config['keywords']) * 0.30,
        'context_match': analyze_context(request, persona_config) * 0.40,
        'historical': get_historical_performance(persona_config['name']) * 0.20,
        'user_pref': get_user_preference(persona_config['name']) * 0.10
    }
    
    # Apply priority boosts
    if persona_config.get('priority_boost'):
        scores['total'] *= persona_config['priority_boost']
    
    # Check anti-patterns
    if has_anti_patterns(request, persona_config.get('anti_patterns', [])):
        scores['total'] *= 0.5
    
    return sum(scores.values())
```

#### Edge Case Handling

1. **Ambiguous Requests**
   - If multiple personas score within 10%, prompt user for clarification
   - Suggest multi-agent collaboration for cross-domain tasks

2. **No Clear Match**
   - Default to analyzer persona for investigation
   - Provide reasoning for delegation decision

3. **Conflicting Priorities**
   - Use persona priority hierarchies to resolve
   - Security and architect personas get precedence for critical decisions

### Multi-Agent Collaboration

#### Collaboration Workflows

```yaml
security_review:
  lead: security
  consult: [backend, architect]
  workflow: analyze → assess → recommend
  handoff_protocol: structured_json

feature_implementation:
  lead: architect
  implement: [frontend, backend]
  review: [qa, security]
  workflow: design → implement → test → secure
  parallel_enabled: true

performance_optimization:
  lead: performance
  analyze: [analyzer]
  implement: [backend, frontend]
  workflow: profile → identify → optimize → validate
  metrics_driven: true
```

### Command Integration

#### Enhanced Commands with Board Integration

- `/sc:analyze --board` → Creates analysis card, shows board progress
- `/sc:implement --board` → Creates implementation card with visual tracking
- `/sc:improve --multi-agent` → Creates coordinated improvement cards
- `/sc:analyze --delegate` → **LEGACY**: Auto-delegates (now uses board)
- `/sc:implement --persona frontend` → Forces specific agent via board assignment

#### New Board Management Commands

- `/sc:board status` → Display current board state with resource usage
- `/sc:board show [card_id]` → Show detailed card information
- `/sc:board move [card_id] [column]` → Manual card management
- `/sc:board pause [card_id]` → Pause resource-intensive tasks
- `/sc:board history` → Show completed cards archive
- `/sc:board metrics` → Performance analytics and optimization insights

#### Agent Management Commands

- `/sc:create-agents` → Initialize all persona sub-agents for board use
- `/sc:agent-status` → View sub-agent health, metrics, and board assignments
- `/sc:agents list` → Show available agents and their capabilities
- `/sc:agents create [persona]` → Create specific persona sub-agent

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading**: Sub-agents created on-demand
2. **Context Caching**: Reuse analysis results
3. **Batch Processing**: Group similar requests
4. **Result Aggregation**: Efficient synthesis algorithms
5. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation

### Success Metrics

- **Task Speed**: 30% faster completion times
- **Parallel Processing**: Up to 3x throughput increase
- **User Satisfaction**: Measurable improvement in outcomes

### Unified Implementation Phases

#### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

**SubAgent Foundation + Board Core**

- [x] Persona parser implementation (`persona_parser.py`)
- [x] System prompt generator (`prompt_generator.py`)
- [ ] Board data model and storage (`card_model.py`, `board_manager.py`)
- [ ] Resource tracking system (`resource_tracker.py`)
- [ ] Basic workflow engine (`workflow_engine.py`)

#### Phase 2: Board Integration

**Visual Workflow + Agent Coordination**

- [ ] ASCII board rendering (`board_renderer.py`)
- [ ] Card creation and movement logic
- [ ] Sub-agent lifecycle integration (`agent_coordinator.py`)
- [ ] Basic command integration (`/sc:board` commands)
- [ ] Error handling and recovery mechanisms

#### Phase 3: Advanced Orchestration

**Multi-Agent Collaboration + User Interface**

- [ ] Enhanced board visualization with real-time updates
- [ ] Multi-agent collaboration workflows (INTEGRATE column)
- [ ] Advanced delegation engine (`delegation_engine.py`)
- [ ] Performance analytics and optimization
- [ ] Interactive card management

#### Phase 4: Production Readiness

**Optimization + Integration Testing**

- [ ] Learning algorithms and pattern optimization
- [ ] Comprehensive error recovery (`recovery_manager.py`)
- [ ] Backward compatibility and migration tools
- [ ] Full integration testing with existing SuperClaude systems
- [ ] Performance tuning and resource optimization

### Backward Compatibility & Migration Strategy

#### Execution Mode Detection

```python
def determine_execution_mode(request):
    \"\"\"Auto-detect simple vs board mode\"\"\"
    
    # Simple mode (feels like current SuperClaude)
    if (
        request.complexity < 0.5 or
        request.estimated_tokens < 5000 or
        \"--immediate\" in request.flags or
        user.preference == \"simple\"
    ):
        return \"simple\"  # Single-agent, immediate execution
    
    # Board mode (full visual orchestration)
    if (
        request.complexity > 0.7 or
        request.multi_domain or
        \"--board\" in request.flags or
        request.requires_coordination
    ):
        return \"board\"  # Multi-agent with visual workflow
    
    return \"prompt_user\"  # Let user choose
```

#### Migration Path

- **Phase 1**: Board system operates alongside existing personas (opt-in)
- **Phase 2**: Auto-detection routes complex requests to board
- **Phase 3**: Board becomes default for multi-step operations
- **Legacy Support**: `--persona-*` flags continue to work indefinitely
- **Fallback**: If board system fails, automatically falls back to documentation personas

### Security Considerations

1. **Agent Isolation**: Each sub-agent operates in isolation
2. **Tool Restrictions**: Enforce principle of least privilege
3. **Audit Logging**: Track all delegations and actions
4. **Rate Limiting**: Prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Access Control**: User-level agent permissions

### Future Enhancements

1. **Learning System**: Agents improve from outcomes
2. **Dynamic Creation**: Generate new personas on-demand
3. **Cross-Project Agents**: Shared expertise pools
4. **Agent Marketplace**: Community-contributed personas
5. **Visual Orchestration**: GUI for agent management
